<div markdown="1">
#### Never crop artwork
Images representing artwork should always be displayed uncropped in their original ratio. Artwork should not be modified to conform to uniform aspect ratios.
</div>

{: .image-aside}

![Don't crop artwork](/whitney-style/assets/images/artwork-dont.png)

<div markdown="1">
#### Limit height of extremely tall artworks
To prevent excessive scrolling, ensure that areas where full sized artwork is displayed limit the height of the work in relation to the viewport.
</div>

{: .image-aside}
![Don't crop artwork](/whitney-style/assets/images/limit-artwork-height.png)
*On artwork pages, images that are larger than the viewport height are scaled to the height of the viewport. Do not display artworks at full resolution if they will be significantly larger than the height of the viewport.*

<div markdown="1">
#### Crop non-artwork images to match their neighbors
Maintain a unified aspect ratio for non-artwork photography, so that images are consistent with each other on a single page. The aspect ratio itself can be determined differently for each page, but they should be the same ratio.
</div>

{: .image-aside}
![Keep non artwork images uniform](/whitney-style/assets/images/non-artwork-do.png)
*__Do:__ Crop images to create a uniform line across the page.*
![Don't have slightly different image heights](/whitney-style/assets/images/non-artwork-dont.png)
*__Avoid:__ using non-artwork images that have slightly different aspect ratios when presenting content of equal hierarchy.*



## Lightboxes

<div markdown="1">
A visitor can click an image to enter a lightbox view of that image.

Use a lightbox:
- to include a caption for an artwork.
- to display a larger version of a thumbnail image.

Do not use a lightbox:
- to display additional text that is not a caption.
- to display a different image.
</div>
