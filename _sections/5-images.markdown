#### Never crop artwork
Images representing artwork should always be displayed uncropped in their original ratio.

#### Limit height of extremely tall artworks
To prevent excessive scrolling, ensure that areas where full sized artwork is displayed limit the height of the work in relation to the viewport.

#### Crop non-artwork images to match its neighbors
Maintain a unified aspect ratio for non-artwork photography, so that images are consistent with each other on a single page. The aspect ratio itself can be determined differently for each page, but they should be the same ratio.

## Lightboxes

A visitor can click an image to enter a lightbox view of that image.

Use a lightbox:
- to include a caption for an artwork.
- to display a larger version of a thumbnail image.

Do not use a lightbox:
- to display additional text that is not a caption.
- to display a different image.
