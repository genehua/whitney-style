title: Typography

In absence of other graphic elements to rely on, typography serves as the primary way to communicate the Whitney's visual identity. On the web, we adhere as closely as possible to the larger type guidelines, while making a few distinctions.

## Typeface

The Whitney's visual system uses Neue Haas Grotesk (NHG) across all materials, including digital interfaces. NHG (alongside similar-looking typefaces) is used by a variety of other institutions and brands native to New York. Therefore, it's important to consistently use the typeface in a way that is specific to the Whitney.

We use two families of Neue Haas Grotesk on the web. NHG Display for headlines, and NHG Text for body copy.

#### Display type

NHG Display is used to set the highest level headlines of pages and page sections. We use a number of display type sizes, but all usages have a few things in common that are distinctive to the Whitney's identity:
- "65 Medium" weight only
- All caps, including the usage of cap-height numbers
- 85% line height
- -0.02% letter spacing

*The general graphic manual specifies a line height of 80%, but a slightly more accommodating specification for digital interfaces is important for two reasons. First, we have less fine-tune control over line breaks, and want to minimize legibility issues with characters that extend above or below the cap height. Second, screens with lower pixel densities will perceive a fuzzier outline of each character, optically filling in the space between lines and creating the impression that the line height is smaller.*

Display type should avoid italics as much as possible. Copy that would otherwise be italicized in text type, such as titles of exhibitions or artworks, should instead use quotation marks to indicate their significance.

#### Text type

The bulk of text in an interface will be set in NHG Text. We use two sizes. The smaller size can be considered the "default" text size, to be the primary way of setting non-display text. The larger size is reserved for extended paragraphs of text: exhibition introductions, extended object labels for artwork, the text of essays and articles, or descriptions for events.

## Combining Type

#### Maximize font size contrast
Font size between display and text type should be as large as possible without generating issues surrounding text wrapping. Generally, the _wider_ the section, the _larger_ the font size of the display type titling that section should be. More information around when to use what font size can be found in [Layout](/7-layout).

#### Minimize the number of type sizes
Generally, pages and sections should strive to contain only two sizes: one display size, and one text size. This is not always possible or beneficial, but before introducing additional type sizes, consider other methods of creating typographic hierarchy:
- Can a header for a smaller section use bold text type instead of display type?
- Can a line break or additional vertical margins be used to differentiate headers from content?
- Can the content be split into smaller columns?

#### Separate differently sized display type
When multiple sizes of display type are necessary for visual hierarchy, use spacing, or images if available, to create separation between differently sized display type.
