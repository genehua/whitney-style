<div markdown="1">
#### Display type
Neue Haas Grotesk (NHG) Display 65 Medium is used to set the highest level headlines of pages and page sections. It should always be used in all caps.
</div>

<div markdown="1">
#### Text type
The bulk of text in an interface will be set in one of two sizes of NHG Text. The smaller size can be considered the "default" text size, to be the primary way of setting non-display text. The larger size is reserved for extended paragraphs of text: exhibition introductions, extended object labels for artwork, the text of essays and articles, or descriptions for events.
</div>

## Using Typography

<div markdown="1">
#### Maximize font size contrast
Font size of display type should be as large as possible without generating excessively short line lengths, or causing text to wrap between words at smaller screen sizes.
</div>

*Just right.*
![Type size contrast: too small](/assets/images/type-size-contrast-small.png)
*Too small.*
![Type size contrast: too large](/assets/images/type-size-contrast-large.png)
*Too large.*

<div markdown="1">
#### Minimize the number of type sizes
Generally, pages and sections should strive to contain only two sizes: one display size, and one text size. This is not always possible or beneficial, but before introducing additional type sizes, consider other methods of creating typographic hierarchy:
- Use bold text type instead of display type for grouping headers
- Separate headers from content with a line break or increased vertical margins
- Split content into columns
</div>

*__Avoid:__ using different type sizes when other forms of structure are in place.*
![Do: Use few font sizes](/assets/images/minimize-font-size-do.png)
*__Do:__ keep type sizes streamlined.*

<div markdown="1">
#### Separate differently sized display type
Before using two display sizes, first see if the smaller display size can be replaced with a bold text size. If multiple sizes of display type are still necessary, use spacing, or images if available, to create separation between differently sized display type.
</div>

*__Do:__ place images between larger and smaller display type to maintain separation.*

<div markdown="1">
#### [PROPOSED] Avoid italics in display type
Display type should avoid italics as much as possible. Copy that would usually be italicized, such as titles of exhibitions or artworks, should instead use quotation marks to indicate their significance.
