title: Layout

Web pages are designed by combining type, images, spacing and components. Similar kinds of information should use similar kinds of layouts.

## Modules

On the web, each page likely contains several distinct sections of loosely related information that may serve completely different purposes, each having its own hierarchical needs. Each of these sections is a "module".

Modules span the full width of the page and usually have a header.

Modules are separated by a horizontal rule.

## Lists

Many pages and modules show an index of items that preview multiple similar types of information (eg. a page of upcoming exhibitions). These lists should

#### Scale appropriately
Scale items smaller if the information in each item is relatively less important, and if the overall list is very long. Scale items larger if the information is more important, or if the number of items is fewer.

#### Image first, text second
Place subheaders, text, and any buttons below images. This creates an even horizontal key line of images in each row while allowing the text below to wrap to however many lines are necessary.
