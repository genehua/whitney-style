Web pages combine type, images, spacing and components into cohesive layouts that allow visitors to complete tasks and find the information they need. Similar kinds of information should use similar kinds of layouts.

## Page Anatomy

To help define Three main types of content structures.


## Regions

Individual regions ha

#### Lead with the image
Place subheaders, text, and any buttons below images. This creates a horizontal key line of images in each row while allowing the text below to wrap to however many lines are necessary.

## Sections

On the web, each page likely contains several distinct sections of loosely related information that may serve completely different purposes, each having its own hierarchical needs. Each of these contained blocks is a _section_.

#### Use large display type by default
Headers for sections should tend towards larger size. Use a smaller display size for multi-column regions.

#### Horizontal rule
Sections are separated by a horizontal rule.

## Lists

Many pages show an index of items that preview multiple similar types of information (eg. a page of upcoming exhibitions). These lists should be designed to best suit the kind of content they serve.

#### Scale list items appropriately
Scale items smaller if the information in each item is relatively less important, and if the overall list is very long. Scale items larger if the information is more important, or if the number of items is fewer.
