title: Components
---

Use icons, buttons, inputs and other visual patterns across whitney.org to simplify information and to create consistent expectations as to what will happen when a visitor interacts with the website.

## Icons

<div markdown="1">
#### Access
Communicate accessibility with standardized icons that exist in an ecosystem larger than the Museum itself.
</div>

{: .image-aside}
![Access icons](/whitney-style/assets/images/access-icons.png)

<div markdown="1">
#### Arrows
Use "up" and "down" arrows when clicking the icon will scroll within the page. Use "left" and "right" arrows to navigate a section that has horizontally scrolling content.

Use the "down" arrow to indicate a `select` dropdown component.
</div>

![Arrows](/whitney-style/assets/images/arrows.png)
*Once scrolled, the header uses an arrow to indicate that the Menu link will scroll back to the top. In a dropdown, a down arrow indicates options to select.*


<div markdown="1">
#### Plus and minus
If clicking will expand or collapse a section, use plus and minus signs.
</div>

{: .image-aside}
![Plus minus](/whitney-style/assets/images/plus-minus.png)
*Plus and minus icons are used to indicate accordions that open and close.*

## Buttons

Use buttons when a single action or set of equally important actions is the main purpose of the section or region. If the action is secondary, use a text link instead.

{: .image-aside}
![Button vs link](/whitney-style/assets/images/button-vs-link.png)
*A link to buy tickets, the primary action of an exhibition page, uses a button. The link to view the performance schedule uses at text link.*

## Arrow Links
<div markdown="1">
Oftentimes, a page section will contain a partial list of a full index of information, showing the most recent or relevant examples of that list. Use arrow links to provide a way for a visitor to navigate to the page containing the full list.

Do not use arrow links when there is no partial list being shown; use a button instead.
</div>

{: .image-aside}
![Arrow Link Do](/whitney-style/assets/images/separate-display-type.png)
*__Do:__ use an arrow link to link to a larger list.*
![Arrow Link Don't](/whitney-style/assets/images/arrow-link-dont.png)
*__Don't:__ use an arrow link when there is no preview of the list.*
## Frames
<div markdown="1">
Frames are elements that wrap a piece of content in a fully bordered box. Use frames as a way to denote content that originates from outside the Museum, and is borrowed in order to provide relevant and contextual information.

When setting alignment of the frame to the rest of the page, use the border as the reference point, not the content within it.
</div>

{: .image-aside}
![Perspectives](/whitney-style/assets/images/perspectives.png)
*A frame is used to enclose individual Perspectives on exhibition pages, to signal thoughts and voices external to the Museum.*
![Catalog Essay](/whitney-style/assets/images/catalog-essay.png)
*A frame encloses the text of an essay excerpted from a catalog, rather than published directly to whitney.org*
