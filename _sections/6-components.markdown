title: Components
---

Use icons, buttons, inputs and other visual patterns across whitney.org to simplify information and to create consistent expectations as to what will happen when a visitor interacts with the website.

## Iconography

<div markdown="1">
#### Access
Keep icon usage to a minimum; descriptive text is preferred whenever there is space. Use icons when space is prohibitively small, to communicate standard accessibility options, or when adhering to a pattern common to the web that would be generally familiar to visitors.
</div>

{: .image-aside}

#### Arrows
Use "up" and "down" arrows when clicking the icon will scroll within the page. Use "left" and "right" arrows to navigate a section that has horizontally scrolling content.

Use the "down" arrow to indicate a `select` dropdown component.


<div markdown="1">
#### Plus and minus
If clicking will expand or collapse a section, use plus and minus signs.
</div>

## Buttons and input

Use a button when the action is the main purpose of the section or region. If the action is secondary, use a text link instead.

Use a checkbox

## Arrow Links
<div markdown="1">
Oftentimes, a page section will contain a partial list of a full index of information, showing the most recent or relevant examples of that list. Use arrow links to provide a way for a visitor to navigate to the page containing the full list.

Do not use arrow links when there is no partial list being shown; use a button instead.
</div>

{: .image-aside}
![Arrow Link Do](/assets/images/separate-display-type.png)
*__Do:__ use an arrow link to link to a larger list.*
![Arrow Link Don't](/assets/images/arrow-link-dont.png)
*__Don't:__ use an arrow link when there is no preview of the list.*
## Frames
<div markdown="1">
Frames are elements that wrap a piece of content in a fully bordered box. Use frames as a way to denote content that originates from outside the Museum, and is borrowed in order to provide relevant and contextual information.

When setting alignment of the frame to the rest of the page, use the border as the reference point, not the content within it.
</div>

{: .image-aside}
![Perspectives](/assets/images/perspectives.png)
*A frame is used to enclose individual Perspectives on exhibition pages, to signal thoughts and voices external to the Museum.*
![Catalog Essay](/assets/images/catalog-essay.png)
*A frame encloses the text of an essay excerpted from a catalog, rather than published directly to whitney.org*
