title: Principles
---

This is a set of guidelines for use in all web-based applications for the Whitney Museum of American Art. It is a guiding ethos applying the larger system of brand guidelines created by Experimental Jetset to the unique challenges and norms of the internet.

As digital technology is always rapidly improving, the intent of these guidelines is to be continually revised as necessary alongside changing patterns in interface design, and as the Museum expands its digital footprint into further channels. These guidelines avoid prescribing exact values, and do not maintain a code-based component library. Rather, they serve as signposts for interaction designers and web developers to make choices when modifying or creating digital interfaces, ensuring that their decisions are underpinned by a cohesive visual system.
