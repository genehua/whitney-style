#### Black, white, and greys
Black foreground on white background serves as the foundation of the identity system. A full spectrum of greys is available, but the majority of usage will be one of two middle greys.

#### Brand colors
Brand colors are available for use, but should be used only in special circumstances (other than for errors), and is to be considered a last resort option when no other forms of differentiation are suitable.

## Using Color

<div markdown="1">
#### Grey as information hierarchy
Use grey text in display type to create separation of secondary information in a single text block.

Do not place grey text above black text in a display text block. Do not use grey display text by itself; it should always be immediately preceded by black text.

Use grey in body type sparingly; communicating hierarchy via margins is preferred.
</div>

![No grey above black](/assets/images/no-grey-above-black.png)
*__Don't:__ Use grey text above black text.*
![No grey by itself](/assets/images/no-grey-by-itself.png)
*__Don't:__ Use grey text without black text.*

<div markdown="1">
#### Grey as altered state
Use grey text to communicate a non-active or disabled state of an element.
</div>

<div markdown="1">
#### Red for errors
Errors should use an AA contrast-compliant red, slightly modified from the brand Red. Do not use other colors to communicate warnings or errors.
