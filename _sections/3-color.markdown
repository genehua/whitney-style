#### Black, white, and greys
Black foreground on white background serves as the foundation of the Museum's palette at large. A full spectrum of greys is available, but the majority of usage will be one of two middle greys.

#### Brand colors
The usage of color (other than for errors) on the web is strictly limited to special circumstances, and is to be considered a last resort option.

## Using Color

Text, icons, and interface elements should use black on a white background as much as possible. There are two main reasons to use grey text: to provide nuance in information hierarchy, or to indicate the state of interface elements. Other colors follow strict usage guidelines.

#### Grey text as information hierarchy

Use grey text in display type to create separation of secondary information in a single text block.

Do not place grey text above black text in a display text block. Do not use grey display text by itself; it should always be immediately preceded by black text.

Use grey in body type sparingly; communicating hierarchy via margins is preferred.

#### Grey text as altered state

Use grey text to communicate a non-active or disabled state of an element.

#### Errors

Errors should use an AA color contrast compliant red, slightly modified from the brand Red.
